The challenge of fitting essential controls and user feedback into such a small space got my creative brain firing. Quite pleased with the simple, clean UI and clear functionality. Learned a lot and can\'t wait for the next challenge!',

At times it\'s very comfortable using much the same thinking as visual design and art direction with which I am familiar. Then there are moments of "ohhhh!" when I learn something new. Seriously love challenging myself to keep learning and have found UX Design utterly fascinating!',

Much like building muscles or learning how to play a musical instrument we need to practice, evaluate, and practice some more in order to achieve mastery. See you all in March and April. Play ball!',

Musicians enter and mix between songs and you never know who will be playing when and with whom.',
