                <p>
                    The day started... roughly but I was able to carve out just under 2 hours to try out a design prompt challenge (thanks <a href="https://sharpen.design/" target="_blank">Sharpen</a>) and have to admit it really brightened my mood. The challenge of fiting essential controls and user feedback into such a small space got my creative brain firing. Quite pleased with the simple, clean UI and clear functionality. Learned a lot and can't wait for the next challenge!

                    A rough draft hi-fi prototype for the Google UX Design Certification. I have learned so much from this program! At times it's very comfortable using much the same thinking as visual design and art direction with which I am familiar. Then there are moments of "ohhhh!" when I learn something new. Seriously love challenging myself to keep learning and have found UX Design utterly fascinating!

                <p>My final project for the Foundations Course of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. I wanted to challenge myself to built this from scratch without tutorial or reference aside from the code docs (MDN). A little daunting at first but ended up with fairly clean code that works as intended, so I'm chaulking it up as a win. Great fun honestly.</p>

                    Got a bit of free time? Are you a nutty baseball fan? Know how to code? Whelp, this is what you get! Just "for fun" type project in large part as a practice exercise. When you are learning a new skill set the best thing you can do is use those skills. Much like building muscles or learning how to play a musical instrument we need to practice, evaluate, and practice some more in order to achieve mastery. See you all in March and April. Play ball!

                <p>A genuinely fun little single page app (SPA) built over lunch break as part of an online challenge. Asked a bunch of friends to beta test it and actually found a fault! The play button, if activated again, caused the timer function to run multiple instances and go berzerker! First QA success and fixed now =)</p>

                <p>Okay, so I may be a huge baseball fan and a lover of history. While studying with The Odin Project, one assignment was to build a simple landing page. I may have gone a bit beyond the brief but had a really fun evening coding this. Ended up liking it so much, it's structure became the skeleton for the site you are viewing now!</p>

                <p>Bright, festive, alluring is what I would call this illustrious band of musicians. What an absolute pleasure to be invited to create a poster for this intrepid band of troubadors. Made up of roughly a dozen musicians, the Flim Flam is more of a olde tyme traveling show than a band in the modern sense. Musicians enter and mix between songs and you never know who will be playing when and with whom.</p>

                <p>An amazing and fun project! Asked to design and layout a collection of small history stories about my neighborhood by the wonderful local historian Katherine Hon. I was excited to not only get to work but to read every entry and learn about some offbeat and unforseen local history. Now in it's second printing!.</p>
